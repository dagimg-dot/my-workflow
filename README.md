# My Workflow

This is a repo for my workflow. It contains my dotfiles, scripts, and other things I use to make my life easier as a day-to-day PC user.

## Powershell

In my powershell file I have a few aliases and functions to make some things in a much simpler way. They are related to git, navigation, opening files, and other things.
